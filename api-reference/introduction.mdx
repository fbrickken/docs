## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an API Key sent in the request header. This is defined in the OpenAPI specification under securitySchemes.

You must include your unique API key in the x-api-key header of each request.

```json
"components": {
  "securitySchemes": {
    "apiKeyAuth": {
      "type": "apiKey",
      "in": "header",
      "name": "x-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```
